# Liftoff Assignments

This repository is the base repo for all assignments in LaunchCode's [Liftoff](http://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/) course.

## Getting Started

If you are enrolled in the Liftoff program, fork this repository and then clone it to your computer. Have a look through the directories. Each one corresponds to an assignment, and the README will provide additional details on the tasks to be carried out.

### Add your repository to the Liftoff index

Open the `LEARNERS.md` for your class (it should be labeled with a month and date) and add your repository below heading for your Liftoff section. Your link should look like one of the following examples, with appropriate substitutions:

```md
[LAST_NAME, FIRST_NAME (@GITHUB_USERNAME)](https://github.com/GITHUB_USERNAME/liftoff-assignments)
```


```md
[FIRST_INITIAL, LAST_INITIAL (@GITHUB_USERNAME)](https://github.com/GITHUB_USERNAME/liftoff-assignments)
```

> *This GitHub repository is public* if you don't want to share your full name choose the second example above.

> The file `LEARNERS.md`, and many of those you'll be working in, are written in a markup language called Markdown. If you're new to markdown, read and bookmark [GitHub's Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Once you've added your link to the learners index, you should stage, commit, and push your changes.

### Make a pull request

Visit your repo page on GitHub and submit a pull request to the **upstream** repository. The upstream repository is the original repo under the LaunchCodeEducation organization that you forked from.

Read and follow the steps in the [GitHub Help article on creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

Your request will be merged by a LaunchCode staff member, and then your addition will be part of the main repository.

### Enable Github Issues

After Making a pull request you will need to *enable Github issues* for your newly minted repository. Github issues are a great tool for communication with other developers. Github issues isn't automatically enabled for forked repositories. You will need to enable them so your mentor will be able to give you feedback through Github. To do this you will need to:

1. Go to your github profile
2. Select your Liftoff-Assignments repository
3. Click on the Settings tab
4. Select the checkbox for Issues
