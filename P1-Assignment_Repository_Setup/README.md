# Liftoff Assignments

This repository is the base repo for all assignments in LaunchCode's [Liftoff](http://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/) course.

## Getting Started

If you are enrolled in the Liftoff program, fork this repository and then clone it to your computer. Have a look through the directories. Each one corresponds to an assignment, and the README will provide additional details on the tasks to be carried out.

### Add your repository to the Liftoff index

Open `LEARNERS.md` and add your repository below heading for your Liftoff section. Your link should look like the following example, with appropriate substitutions:

```md
[LAST_NAME, FIRST_NAME (@GITHUB_USERNAME)](https://github.com/GITHUB_USERNAME/liftoff-assignments)
```

> The file `LEARNERS.md`, and many of those you'll be working in, are written in a markup language called Markdown. If you're new to markdown, read and bookmark [GitHub's Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Once you've added your link to the learners index, you should stage, commit, and push your changes.

### Make a pull request

Visit your repo page on GitHub and submit a pull request to the **upstream** repository. The upstream repository is the original repo under the LaunchCodeEducation organization that you forked from.

Read and follow the steps in the [GitHub Help article on creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

Your request will be merged by a LaunchCode staff member, and then your addition will be part of the main repository.
