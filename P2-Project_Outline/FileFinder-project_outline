## 1. Overview
This project will assist a file manager at a human services organization by cataloging the physical 
paper files of consumers participating in the programs offered by the organization. The files are 
organized by program and are split between different rooms in several buildings. As one consumer may 
participate in more than one program, the consumer may have more than one case manager. A case manager 
belongs to only one program and oversees multiple consumers.

When the admissions director who oversees the file manager needs to know if an applicant is already
in the system (possibly as an inactive consumer), the file manager will be able to query the data. 
Inactive consumer files need to be confidentially shredded after a period of 7 years and 1 day.

## 2. Features
* Authorized User Login: project is only accessible to file manager and admin. 
* Daily Tasks: 
    - show inactive files due to be shredded based on current date and consumer end date
    - show full or damaged files due for new file creation
* Data Queries: find files based on consumer name, case manager, program, room, and building
* Email Case Managers: to inform them of paperwork discrepencies within the files.
* Audits: pull random list of files to perform quarterly audits. 

## 3. Technologies
I will be creating an ASP.Net Core MVC application in C#, with persistent data stored in an 
Entity Framework SQLServer database. 

## 4. Things I'll Have to Learn
* Session logins with ASP.Net.
* Enhanced security and validation.
* Patience in manipulating such a large project.
