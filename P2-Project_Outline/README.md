### Technologies
In this project we have decided to take on more than a few challenges.
We are building our project with Maven instead of Gradle.
MongoDB a non relational document database.
POStman Api to set endpoints to test out our backend code without having front end done.
Java as our language for back end development.
Angular Material for our front end. 
Also using Dockers for easy testing, runnning and shipping of our application.
### What I'll Have to Learn
How to connect a non relation database to our code. How to build the project using
Maven instead of Gradle. How to use POStman Api. The correct format for querying in a non
relation database like MongoDB. The correct Syntax for using Mongo and Dockers in a project.
