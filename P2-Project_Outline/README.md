## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Have you ever needed something right here and right now, but had no idea where or how to get it? We here at 3rd World Developers are here to help with your endevours. Introducing Near Me! An app with the sole purpose of finding that one thing you need right in that moment of time but don't know where to find it. You will be able to search for a specific item and be sent results of closest stores or individuals that have that item up for sale, with details on price and distance.

The idea came when I was looking to use a specific tool that I could not, for the life of me, figure out where to find one. So I want to build an app that caters to those looking for an item and if they are not available. One can post that item that they are looking for, and someone who may not be posting it up for sale, but has it and doesn't care to seel it, can see it and sell it to them.
