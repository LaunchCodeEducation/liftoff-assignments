## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This is a project to help small food manufacturers comply with the Food Safety Modernization Act by simplifying record keeping and data tracking.  The project will include a database of products manufactured, ingredients, vendors, and customers.  It will allow employees to print detailed ingredient lists for customers and regulators and track to whom those lists have been distributed.  Employees will also have the ability to send procurement requests to the distribution manager when stocks get low.  Eventually I would like to expand the project to be a more complete inventory management system including taknig orders from customers and interfacing with external accounting software such as QuickBooks.

### Features
-Print/display detailed ingredient lists for all manufactured products.  These reports should include sourcing information and be customizable.
-Track where products and ingredient sheets have been delivered.  For example be able to display a map and detailed info on which customers have been delivered a particular product and if they have the appropriate ingredient sheets.
-Allow communication between departments for restocking purposes.
-Provide checklists to ensure documentation of food handling safety practices and allow easy access to those records.

### Technologies
This will be a web application based on a Java backend using SpringBoot and Hibernate to communicate my a MySQL database.  The frontend will be based on ThymeLeaf HTML templates and possibly some JavaScript for more interesting features.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I wdll need to learn more about database design to help with creating an efficient and manageable database.  I will also need to learn APIs for QuickBooks to help with order tracking and billing and GoogleMaps to work with visualizing various customer and vendor data.
