## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be an expense tracker that will allow users to track their expenses by time, date, and category. Users will be able to create an account, log in, create, edit, and remove expense_categories, create, edit, and remove expenses. They will be able to review all expenses, expenses by month, and expenses by category.

I decided to make this project because I am getting married next year, and weddings are expensive. I want to track the expenses of the wedding, and generally have a better understanding of my own expenses to better plan for my finacial future. This application can be beneifical for anyone that is looking to gain insight on their own spending habits.

My project will be a companion finder that will allow users to find individuals with whom to do specific, one-time activities.  Users will be able to create an account, log in, create, edit, remove, browse, and search for activities, view other users' profiles, and chat with other users.

I decided to make this project because I moved to St. Louis last year and found it difficult to find someone to join me in "trying out that restaurant/bar down the street", or "watch this movie that is currently in theaters", since I had very few friends in the area.  Meetup is activity-focused, but it's more for groups that will continually do a similar activity, and dating sites are (1) specifically for dating and (2) more about meeting people. Think of it as a dating site where you first choose an activity for a date, then people offer to do the activity with you (doesn't have to be a dating context).  This application can be beneficial for people who are new in town, don't have many friends, want a different approach to dating, or like hanging out with strangers.

### Features

View User Profiles:  Users will be able to see other users' profiles so they can be selective about who they spend time with.
Edit, Create, and Delete Activities: Users will be able to create new activities they want to do. Activities will be flexible, and can be edited, and deleted.
Browse/View Activities: Users will be able to view other users' activities to see if there's something they want to do.
Chat:  Users will be able to send messages to one another in order to make plans.
