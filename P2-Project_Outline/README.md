### Overview
My best friend Sue Miller has plans to feed their neighbors for free with a 
small community garden.  They got a bit of a late start and
does not know where to begin.  They spent half their day trying 
to determine if tomatoes would grow best with jalapenos and the 
best area of their garden to grow broccoli that needs lots of shade.
Our Garden Planner app is here for Sue, a novice, and even those with 
the greenest thumb. The mission of our Garden Planner app is to
take the guess-work out of seeding and planting your crops.  We have 
done the work of determining the best companion plants for Sue's tomatoes,
determining their grow zones, finding them the best deals on seeds and much more via 
a user-friendly application. Go from seed to harvest much faster using our Garden Planner app now via Google Play or 
Apple App Store.
### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application.  Each user will have a profile page.
Search: Users will be able to search for seeds and see a listing of best prices and retail locations.  Users will also be able to search for vegetables/fruits and receive information regarding best companion plants and succession plants for that crop.
Layout Creator:  Users will be able to map out their gardens using the layout tool.
Profile: Users will be able to create their own profile which will let them select their geographic region and automatically provide growing zone information for that region.
