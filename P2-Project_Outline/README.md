## Submission Instructions

### Overview

My project will be a web application to manage live performance in various facets. Talent-seekers will be
able to create profiles and put out casting calls for what specific talent they need. Job-seekers will then
be able to create their own profiles and search for positions put out by the talent-seekers -- all in one free,
convenient place that does not currently exist.

On top of that, there will be a master calendar created based on location to find all performance art happening
within a specific region. Want to go experience a theater or production or unique performance art instead of a movie
on a Friday night? Well now there's a place to go looking
for something. Want an easy place to go to find auditions outside of your city and normal networking circles? It's all here.
Facebook has become too cluttered and can be difficult to manage and find events. This will be an easier place to go,
as well as serve more purposes in the community than what others, like facebook, can provide.

### Features

User Login: Users will be able to create different kind of accounts with unique tools and login. Each user will be able
to create a detailed profile page to either market themselves or describe their company.

Create Post: Companies will be able to create jobs in a searchable manner, and both companies and users will be able to
create events.
