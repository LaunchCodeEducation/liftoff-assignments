## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will register student to different courses and allow track their credits. It will allow admin members to log in, and to create and edit student details such as lastname, firstname, year, address, course, total credit, student payments.
This project was motivated by the need of a organization that wants a way to keep track of and view individual student information.

### Features
login: Students will be able to log in, either by creating accounts in the system, or by using a admin authentication.
- Add and edit student information: Admin will be able to add new students in the system by entering in a mixture of required (name, year, address, course, etc)
- View student records and information: Students will be able to view their credits, and other information.
- Search student or records: Admin will be able to search student by their lastname to the system, and to assign credits and payment information.
- Delete records: Admin will be able to delete records if any.
	
### Technologies
 Java

- MySQL
- Thymeleaf templates
- Bootstrap

- Css


### What I'll Have to Learn
For the login functionality, I'll have to learn something new in either scenario. I'll need to learn how to use the login approach for both students and admin. Restricted access for students who can just view their credits and their information. Whereas admin staff can search edit delete or add records or students information.
I'll also be using test-driven development, writing tests for my code before writing the code itself. I don't have much experience doing this in Spring, so I'll have to learn how to use its testing capabilities.
