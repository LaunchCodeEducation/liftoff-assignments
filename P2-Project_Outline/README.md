## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here
Recently I visited the Nelson and went to the exhibit "Through the eyes of Picasso". I have always liked his abstract style but never realized that a lot of his inspiration came from African Ceremonial masks amongst many others masks from all over the globe. I want to create a space were users can have a profile where they can collect a gallery of their own with favorite art pieces from history. I believe that one of the most interesting things about art is how it speaks differently to people and why they like it. They will be able to explore other users galleries and pick pieces of public domain art to add to their own gallery. I would like to include a tagging functionality that will let users choose what words they associate with different pieces as well. I think this will help inspire others to connect through art.
