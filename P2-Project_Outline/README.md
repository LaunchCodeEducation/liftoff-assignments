# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
 - In high school Chemistry, there are several basic (yet critical) skills that students must master.  These include taking quality measurements, performing metric conversions, dealing with significant figures/scientific notation, solving problems using dimensional analysis and writing chemical formulas.
 - Each of these skills gets better with practice, but how much practice a student needs varies from person to person.  Providing each student with just the right amount of practice AND timely feedback is challenging.
 - While online resources exist for each of the skills, not all of the websites are being maintained, nor is there a single site that provides all of the content.
 - The goal of this project is to create modules to provide teachers and students flexible activities that will introduce, reinforce and assess proficiency in each of the core skills.
 - This project will begin with the concept of significant figures.  The "practice" functionality will be established first, followed by interactive tutorials (for use in a 'flipped' classroom) and finally options for assessing proficiency.
 - (Add future ideas here...)
### Features
 - Interactive tutorials to help introduce students to the new skills.
 - "Infinite practice" options that provide immediate feedback to help students master the new skills.
 - Optional performance tracker (e.g. "80% proficient") to help students gauge their level of mastery.
 - Optional homework setting to let teachers assign and see the results of student work (will require login and/or messaging functionality).
### Technologies
 - Python
 - HTML
 - Flask
 - Bootstrap
 - JavaScript (maybe)
 - SQLAlchemy (if login functionality is needed)
 - Google Classroom (maybe)

### What I'll Have to Learn
 - JavaScript (for performance tracker)
 - Review database I/O using Python and SQLAlchemy
 - How to allow a student to send performance results to his/her teacher
 - Integrate results with Google Classroom?
