### Overview
Include overview here

My idea for the capstone project is a website that will help me keep track of my dog sitting clients. It will allow
users to signup and login as well as create a profile. Users will be able to add information such as: phone number,
address, email, number of pets and their names, dietary restrictions, health history for pets, the vet information
for the pet. I am also wanting to create a way that clients can message me and request dates which they would like
me to dogsit.

### Features
