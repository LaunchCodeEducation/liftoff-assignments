## Assignment Description
[Project Outline Assignment](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/assignments/project-outline/)

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
"The Pokemon Craigslist". PokemonGo created friendshipId's and initiated trading. This android app store companion app
will allow users to submit which pokemon they have and what they want. Since you must be in close proximity in reality,
it will store a zipcode and a distance you are willing to travel. Additionally, you will tell me how other users get
in touch with you and good times of the day to do so. Once your advertisement is submitted, I hope to show
automatched suggestions, or you will be able to search other's ads by distance and desired pokemon. Find someone,
contact them! (external to my app, internal opens me up to liability)

    -If Android App fails, will redesign as website.

    -Not my idea; I haven't played in over a year. I have a user requesting and guiding this build.
