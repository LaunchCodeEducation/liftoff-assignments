## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project is called Workout Builder. I thought of the idea as I was talking to different people, friends, and family about their struggles with getting in shape. Most people said their problem wasn't getting to the gym, it was what to do once they were there; the majority said they were lost and felt like their time was wasted. 

For that reason, I wanted to create an app that will help people build a workout to reach their healthier lifestyle goals. The app allow users to sign in, put in their starting health information, and determine whether they are at a beginner, intermediate or advanced level. From there the user can say how much time they have that day (30 mins - 2 hrs) and what part of their body they are working on for that specific workout (upper body, lower body, full body, etc.). The app will build a workout for them for that day, with specific exercises that target their goals. The app will then store their information so when they sign in the next time they will be able to use the same workout, create new workouts, track their progress, and build on it. 
### Features
user signin-Each user will have a the ability to create accounts and log in to the app.
search workouts function-The users will have the ability to search all excersises in app.
CRUD=They will have the ability to create workouts, update their information, and delete previous workouts they may not want
SMS text and calendar integration- I'd like to have the app integrate with their calendar so they can add their workout and receive a text message an hour our two before to remind them.

### Technologies
Java
springboot
thymeleaf
mySQL
bootstrap
javascript
API

### What I'll Have to Learn
I am going to need to learn how to connect 3rd party APIs, SMS integration, more bootstrap, as well as javascript for the front end.
