### Overview

Have you ever looked through your closet and wondered when was the last time you wore any of this stuff?
Well, Sweaterhawk is here to help. Log seldom worn articles into the app and Sweaterhawk starts a timer.
One year later, if the article hasn't been worn, Sweaterhawk reminds you to donate that piece.
If you wear the item, say for a formal event or to make a quirky outfit, log back into Sweaterhawk and mark the item "worn" to reset the timer.
Keep your closet clean and your community clothed with Sweaterhawk.
