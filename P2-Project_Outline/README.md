## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a resale shop inventory. A resale shop is a store that takes items from you and sells them and gives you some of the profit. I got this idea because my mom takes items to a resale shop that she doesn't want anymore. She told me they don't keep track of the things you take there. So she has to keep track of them herself by writing what she takes in a notebook. I thought I can make that easier for her.

In my app users will be able to log in and keep track of what items they take to which resale shops. They can enter items into each specific list for each store. There will also be a section of the app that can keep track of monthly income. The user will be able to enter the amount of any check received from individual stores to see which store is making them the most money.
### Features
User login: Users will be able to log in and see their home page list of each store they take items to.
Add item in store: Users will be able to add items to a certain store. They will be able to add a category name to the item and add multiple items at a time.
Delete item in store: Users will be able to delete items in a certain store.
Create Store name: users will be able to add store names that they take items to.
Amount Received/ Income: Users will be able to enter the amount of any check received from individual stores.
Search: Users will be able to search for items.
### Technologies
Java, Springboot, Thymeleaf, Gradle, JavaScript
### What I'll Have to Learn
I want to learn more about JavaScript and try to make the front end more interactive because I think that will be interesting to learn. Also, I will be using an API to keep track of where resale shops are located.
