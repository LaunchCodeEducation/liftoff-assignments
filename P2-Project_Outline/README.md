### Overview

The application that I am developing for my Liftoff Capstone Project, is called KnowYourZone. 

Health care providers are frustrated by the fact that patients often cannot effectively assess whether they are facing a true emergency or not. Frivolous patient visits to the doctor or ER unnecessarily burden the healthcare system. Meanwhile, patients who are not receiving the medical attention they need are jeopardizing their health. This is especially true for patients that have chronic medical conditions whose symptoms can vary greatly from time to time. Patients need to understand when to seek medical attention based on their symptoms at the moment.

The purpose of this application is to help patients more efficiently and effectively manage their chronic medical conditions. This application guides these patients towards understanding what type of medical attention they should seek given their conditions and the symptoms they are experiencing at that particular time. The three options are: not seeking any medical attention at this time, setting an appointment to have the symptoms examined by a medical provider in the near future, or presenting to an emergency room immediately. These three options are represented by the green, yellow, and red zones, respectively. 

### Features

WhatsYourZone Feature:
This feature allows app users to know what zone they’re in, and the appropriate course of action to take, based on their condition and symptoms. Users fill out a questionnaire, and their answers are scored. The zone is determined by the score. The Green Zone is where medical attention is not needed at this time. The Yellow Zone is where a patient should seek medical attention but can wait to see their doctor at the time of the appointment. The Red Zone is where there’s an emergency, and a patient should seek immediate medical attention, e.g. going to the ER.

KnowYourCondition Feature:
This feature allows users to obtain information about their chronic condition. Users will have the option to select a medical condition from a menu and retrieve information and links to other web sites about it.

KnowYourProvider Feature:
This feature allows users to obtain information about and locations of providers that treat their particular condition. This feature also allows users to narrow the search to providers that are appropriate for their particular zone, e.g., only listing emergency healthcare providers for the Red Zone of a condition.

### Technologies

These technologies are what’s being used to develop this application:
•	Python 
•	Java
•	Flask
•	MySQL
•	SQLAlchemy


### What I'll Have to Learn

To complete this app, use of Google Maps API is necessary. This technology is needed to enable the KnowYourProvider feature to list the providers’ locations.
