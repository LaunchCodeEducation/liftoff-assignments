### Overview
# JRMS
### Joey's Record Management System
Record holdings management tool that aids in storage, retrieval and destruction of paper records. I want to use this as a chance to work with Grails and React. I chose this project idea because I use similar software at work. I belive the clarity of vision provided by that will make it easier to focus on learning Grails and React and desigining my project's functionality rather than having to make frequent changes to a plan that I don't have a clear vision for.  


### Features
* **Single Page App**: everything will work as an SPA, no reloading or redirecting 

* **Login/Logout**: users can log in and log out

* **Welcome page**: after loging in users land on splash page with tabs for search and data entry areas 

* **Selective view of db**: You only see records you are currently working with because loading up potientially milions  of records you aren't using would be counterproductive 

* **Registry numbers**: records are assined registrey numbers upon entry that are linked to a physical location for later retrieval 

* **Shelf life**: in addition to reg number, records are also assigned a shelf life of 99 years before they are to be destroyed

* **Data Entry**: able to add new records 

* **Record information changes**: able to change information across all records by an owner (ie if they get married and change their last name)

* **Delete Records**: able to delete records from the db

* **Search Records**: able to search for records by ssn, dob or name and get the registry number

* **Digital charge slip**: you can add charge slips to a record to let others know you have pulled that record

* **Print Labels**: print labels for boxes, records etc.

* **View Reports**: view/print reports on all of the aforementioned 


### Technologies
Grails
React
Java 
Groovy
Javascript 
mySQL
html
css

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to apply my experience from unit 3 to learn Grails and Groovy just as we did Spring and Java. I will also have to learn some react and javascript in order to get my project working as an SPA. I'm excited to delve into those new(to me) technologies.
