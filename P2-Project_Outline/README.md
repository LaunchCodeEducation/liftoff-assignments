# Project Outline
### Overview
For this assignment, Planning to build a Flight reservation app that can be accessed from multiple devices.

### Goal
Goal is to develop a end to end java based project in MVC architectural style. As part of this, have idea to create a micro services and integrate them into the UI component.

### Features
Come up with functional and also non-functional requirements in order to build this project.
  ## Functional Features
     - User Registration and Login: User will have the self service Sign-Up capability and can Sign-In with his own credentials.
     - Search Flights: Users will have the search capabilities by providing different search criteria like Airlines name, Flight Number, Arrival Time, Departure Time, From City, To City etc..
     - Book Flight : Users can book the flights for their future travel.
     - Check In : Users can generate the Check In pass in online.

  ## Non Functional Features
     - Logging : Building a logging module to log sysout, syserror, audit logs and push them   into Log management system like Splunk or Papetrail.
     - Security : Building a authentication and authorization services to enforce the access controls based on used types like end users, admin etc..
     - Deployment : Building a CI/CD pipelines in order to integrate the new features into the master branch and push the master branch into live PROD environment on regular basis.

### Technologies
Planning to use Spring Boot based java technologies, tools and frameworks in this project development. See the more details as below.
  ## Data Access Layer -  Spring Data to perform different CURD operations on MySQL database.
  ## Service Layer - Simple Java Interfaces and classes for Business Domain logic.
  ## Controller Layer - Spring MVC to handle the requests and responses.
  ## Presentation Layer - Spring MVC, HTML5, CSS3, JSP, Java Script.
  ## Integration Layer - Spring Rest Data to expose the Rest API's to Presentation Layer.
  ## Utility Layer - Spring Email templates, Java Mail Sender
  ## Report Generation - JFree Charts
  ## Testing Rest API - Postman Chrome PlugIn
  ## Build & Deployment - Jenkins Pipeline and Pivotal Cloud/Heroku (PaaS)
  ## Log Management System - Splunk or Papertrail

### What I'll Have to Learn
By building this project end to end, my goal is to learn Micro Services, 12-factor application development and leverage the capabilities of the Cloud Distributed Computing platform like Pivotal Cloud Foundry or Heroku.
