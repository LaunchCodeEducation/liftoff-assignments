# Project Outline

### Overview
I am developing a Classroom Wish List Web App. Teachers and Administration will be able to create user profiles, log in, and submit donation requests. Family and community
members can also create a user profile, log in, and use the app to identify the current needs of the school and claim items they would like to donate. Family and community
members will also be able to create a new donation if they have an item or items that has not been requested yet. The Educator can then claim their donation. As a member of the
John Hopkins Middle School PTSA, I have seen the need for a donation management system. Family and community members are hesitant to donate to the PTSA, because they want
to see firsthand where their money is going. Additionally, with everyone's busy schedule and lack of communication, it is difficult to know what is needed at any given point. 
The Classroom Wish List Web App will connect educators and the community in a way that hasn't been done yet.

### Features
- User Login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
- Search: Users will be able to search for donation requests containing given text.
- Create Donation Request: Educator Users will be able to create new donation requests when logged in. New requests will appear in the user's profile.
- Submit Donation: Community Users will be able to create new donation submissions when logged in. New submissions will appear in the user's profile.
