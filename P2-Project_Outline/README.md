## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This is a project to create a task list that will only show one task at a time. It is created for people who feel overwhelmed by a long to-do list, which can lead to a lack of productivity. It will help them focus on one task at a time, so they can do the things they need to do.
The idea came from my own experience of either feeling that I needed to work on every item on my list at the same time, or ending up doing nothing because the feeling of overwhelm lead to a kind of paralysis.
### Features
--"One Thing" window: this shows the one thing that the user is doing right now
--"All the Things" window: this shows the full task list, and allow the user to edit the list.
--"Time Buckets": In the "All the Things" window, tasks can be sorted into "time buckets", that is, a group of tasks to be done in the morning, and another group to be done in the afternoon.
--Advise panels: these are areas that offer advice for how to set up a useful task list, helping the user to focus on urgent and important tasks for less stress and more productivity
