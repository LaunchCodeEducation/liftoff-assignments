### Overview
B-plate is full-stack Java web-application boilerplate for the most common use cases. It is meant as a starting point to allow developers to focus their time on unique functionality and speed up development.

The most common features that every application needs are provided for -- user management, content management, security and authentication, and password management.  Additionally, examples of private user data and pages are provided as a task management tool to help the developer get started with unique functionality.

### Features
The following features are provided by b-plate "out-of-the-box" in a MVC pattern:

- **User authentication, roles, and permissions:** Users will be authenticated with a session after login, and have access to content and features that are specific to their role.
- **SMS 2-factor authentication:** Users will be able to optionally use two-factor authentication with SMS during login.
- **Account management:** Users can register for a new account, login, and reset their passwords.
- **Private personal user data:** An example task management feature is provided with a custom class, Dao, and service that gives users access to a personal page with their own data.
- **Content management system:** Administrators and Publishers can create new public marketing pages from a CMS with a WYSIWYG without altering the code and redeploying the application.
- **Image uploads:** Administrators and Publishers can upload images to the file system through the UI.
- **Email server with SendGrid:** Users can reset their passwords and verify their email on signup, a full email service can be easily used to extend new features.

### What I'll Have to Learn
The biggest area of learning for me will be Spring Security and how to put together an effective security configuration.  Other technologies that are new to me are Sass and the Twilio API.  Another challenge will be the image upload feature.  I am also extending my knowledge of JavaScript to enable animations and dynamic page rendering.
