## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here

All-in-one alarm clock/multi-timer app. User based and simple, user friendly-functionality. Will center around the alarms, and the ability to set multiple alarms that similar but occur every week/month/etc. Hopefully going to have the ability to have sms integration for modile usage. Also going to try and set up so called "routine timers" which can be set up to start at will or when an alarm goes off. A routine timer has multiple "stops" which activate a message or audio when it hits certain marks. For example, a morning routine might have a stop for getting dressed after 5 minutes, and then one for brushing after 10 minutes, and so on. Will also hopefully have a multi-clock interface for different timezones around the world.

Mainly idea came from, as an ongoing idea within my family, as a young person, to have a simple, very accessible, non-complex, user friendly alarm clock, which seems to be almost non-existant these days, anything mainstream at least, based off a freeware piece called Handy Free Clock, which served all my family members very well for years
