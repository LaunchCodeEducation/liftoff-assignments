## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This app will allow a user to search for and find local restaurants that offer a kids’ menu. The idea for this app came from a conversation with a mother who expressed frustration with not being able to find a resource that could give her options for restaurants with kids’ menus in one place, rather than search local restaurants and then go to their website or call them to find out if they offer such a menu. Other apps, such as Yelp or Google Maps, can be used to find “family friendly” or “kid friendly” restaurants, based on the opinion from a reviewer of a restaurant, but this app will only feature restaurants that specifically have dedicated kids’ menus and/or items labelled on their menus as being offered for children. The user will also be able to filter their results based on type of cuisine. Lastly, the user will be able to establish and log into their account where they will be able to create lists of these restaurants that are their favorite or that they would like to try.### Features
