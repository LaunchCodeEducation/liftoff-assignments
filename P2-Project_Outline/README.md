## Assignment Description
[Project Outline Assignment](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/assignments/project-outline/)
This system is named as Student Attendance System.
 This system is made to keep the records about the attendance of the students and the feedback given by the
  teachers on the students’ courses.

 The admin can manage all the teacher and student accounts and the registered users like teachers and students
   can only manage their own accounts.
 Teachers can mark the attendance of the students and can give grades on courses and can also see all
   the student's attendance and grades. Teachers can also give feedback to the students on courses and attendance.
   students have many modules like checking the messages uploaded by their teacher, their result, their test marks,
   their attendance, their fee status etc.

  The difference between student interface here is that students can only see this data and cannot make any changes
  to the data that is shown.
  This attendance management system can be used by any school or non-profit organization.

  This software reduces the amount of time and manual data entry and it also gives greater efficiency.
  The User Interface of it is extremely friendly and can be easily used by anyone.


  All the details about students, teachers and their other tasks can only be seen by the verified users.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a student attendance system that will allow users (teachers and students) to track attendance by date, and course. Users (teachers) will be able to create an account, log in, create, edit teacher profile and can take attendance . Users(students) can create an account, log in and can see their attendance. Admin will be able to review everything and all profiles.
I decided to make this project because I wanted to help Launchcode and give them an easy friendly application that will help them to check and manage attendance. I’ve learnt so much from LaunchCode and wish to provide them with a web app that will help them to better plan for upcoming courses,
This application can be beneficial for any institution that have students and teachers.

 writing tests for my code before writing the code itself. 
 I don't have much experience doing this in Spring, 
so I'll have to learn how to use its testing capabilities.
