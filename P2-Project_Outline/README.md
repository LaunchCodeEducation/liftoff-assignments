## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Check Mate:
Have you ever been interested in someone but not been so trusting of what they were telling you? Or do you just want to make sure they were the kind of person you wanted around? This app will be a rating/review app so that your ex's can review you. Sound scary? Don't worry, people will need to sign an agreement before posting anything that it contains nothing slander-ous. If you were to feel it was slander, you could report it and someone from the app would get notified to look at the comment and review it. The app will also link local API's from local counties to show any arrest records and the marriage status of the person. This app could save people a lot of heart ache and time if they could know the truth about people ahead of time and have some insight to what this potential "mate" is really like. 

### Features
1. Sign up: Members will need to be 17+ to prevent adolecent behavior on the app. They will also need to sign an agreement before joining that states they will not slander anyone. When signing up they will be able to participate in the rest of the apps features and rate and review ex's.
2. Rating System: Users will beable to rate ex's on a five star system and an average will be generated based on ex's star ratings.
3. Review System: Users will beable to share their reviews on their ex's. They can essentially share their side of the story, good experiences, bad experiences, and anything they felt future mates of theirs would NEED to know.
4. Arrest Records: This could be very beneficial to single parents or domestic violence survivors or anyone who is prone to getting involved with people who could be very tumultuous in their lives. 
5. Marriage Status: This could help people for being a "side piece" or a "homewrecker". It would provide people with the truth and avoid them getting into anything that they were not trying to get into. 

### Technologies

Because my app is similar to Yelp in many ways, I will use the same kind of technologies they use;
Ubuntu
Apache
MySQL
Python/PHP

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn how to link local API's and how to find marriage certificates to link those to the app as well. I will also need to dive deeper into one to one relationships as well.
