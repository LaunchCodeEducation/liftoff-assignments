# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Over the past three years or so, I've really gotten interested in tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons. I've played in three different campaigns, and I always found it fun to get together with my family and friends and go on a fantastical adventure with them. I've even met some new friends playing these games, and I was surprised to learn there wasn't really a way to meet up with people outside your social circle to play.

That's what my Capstone project, called LFP (Looking for Party), is all about. LFP will allow users to create an account, either as a player or as a Game Master, then find other people to play with in their area. Players and GMs will be able to send messages to each other to get ideas for their characters or campaigns or set up play sessions with each other.
### Features
#### User Accounts
Users will be able to set up an account and log into their personal profile. Users will have the ability to set up a player account or a Game Master account, each with slight variations.
#### Location Services
By using location information for users, the app will be able to connect players and Game Masters with each other within a specified area.
#### Private Messaging
Users will be able to message one another to set up meetings and play sessions. Each user will have their own private inbox.
### Technologies
Java
Spring Boot
Gradle
MySQL
HTML
Bootstrap templates

### What I'll Have to Learn
Using location services will be a new thing for me. The idea is to have the app redirect to a landing page once users log in that shows them players or GMs near them, so that will be a learning experience. Setting up a unique inbox for each user and making sure that works properly might also have its challenges.

### Project Tracker
For this project, I have decided to use Pivotal Tracker to track the development progress of LFP. [The tracker can be found here.](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2185442)
