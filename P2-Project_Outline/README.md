## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I'd like to make a web app social media site for bikers, allowing them to save, review and publish their favorite ride routes. The routes and their reviews will be displayed with map API. Multiple API's will be required for final app concept. They will also be able to make/save friends, communicate online, plan/schedule ride dates and keep an eye on the weather! If forcast is poor for the ride or traffic backs up, riders would be notified ahead of time.

Users make accounts.Passwords.Emails.
Users can save addresses of Begining and End of routes for their favorite bike ride in a format that they will just save it as A "Favorite Route",
Each "favorite route" will display as a Google route map via API along with an associated User "Review" that will also be saved in a relational database.
-Users can make friends and save them to a DB.
-Users can send eachother messages(May try to implement instant messaging with "sockets")
-Users can set ride meet ups on a calandar with their "friends". (Maybe set up alert system, and/or even use another API is there Google Calandar?)(Could even possibly have Scheduled dates check weather and forcast if the Ride will be canceled!)
### Features
-User Login: Verifications, Emails, Locations?, Preffered Bike, Verify they are rider?
-Save Bike Ride Routes: Saved to public database accesible by ALL users of the site. Will include written Review. Reviews can be added in the future by ANY User of the site.
-Display Saved Bike Route: Will include written Review(s).
-Set Route as a Favorite: Saves Route to a specific User db.
-Invite Friend
-Message Friend
-Set ride "Meet Ups": With other friended Users.
-Warns if scheduled "Meet up" should be cancled due to weather. Or traffic?
-Maybe implement "Instant Messaging".

### Technologies
-C#
-ASP.NET
-Core
-Entity Framework

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have alot to learn about using public API's and customizing them. Possibly learn some about "sockets". If I can get a little more creative with the JavaScript I would like too. But mostly the relationships between all the API's I plan on using will be a new experience.
