## Submission Instructions

### Overview
	I am going to create a book review website that will factor the user’s interests in the rating of a book.  
For example, I have a background in history and philosophy.  If I were to rate a book from the Young Adult Romance Novel 
genre, my rating should have the ability to be factored differently than a reviewer who enjoys reading novels from that genre.
The primary numerical rating of the book review should not be affected by the reviewer’s interests.  Users should have the 
ability to view a specific book’s rating by reviewers’ interests.  Using myself as an example again, my favorite genres would 
be history and philosophy.  Therefore, when I review a book, the book will have the generic rating of 1-10, but it will also 
show the rating of people who have history as their favorite genre and a separate rating for those who listed philosophy as 
their favorite genre.  

	The website will help recommend books to like-minded people that are outside their favorite areas of interest and, 
more importantly, give a more accurate rating for books.   People pigeonhole themselves intellectually.  This website 
will allow users to branch outside of their areas of interest based on reviews by others who were brave enough to do so. 
Similar to how liberals tend to consume liberal media and conservatives consume conservative media, this website will 
allow for, at the very least, consumers of knowledge to understand the appeal of another genre and, as result, possess 
a better understanding of each other.  

### Features
	The user must create an account.  S/he will have a unique profile page that will list their books reviewed,
	along with their reviews and ratings.  The user also must choose at least one favorite genre and as many as three 
	from a dropdown box.  Their choices will be used to determine a book’s review based on their favorite genres.  
	Furthermore, users will be able to search for books by username, book titles, book authors and genre.  

### Technologies
	I will use C#, ASP.NET, Bootstrap, and…?

### What I'll Have to Learn
	I will learn how to utilize data from a public API.  How do I do this?  That’s to be determined.  Ideally, I would 
	like to gain access to a database of books through an API.  I will also learn Bootstrap.  It was used on occasion
	in the class, but it wasn’t taught.  I’m not sure how much of a process this task will be.
