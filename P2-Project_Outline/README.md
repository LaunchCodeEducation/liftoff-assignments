### Overview

** Project Title: Online Event Planning System **

    As people spend lots of money and time for planning & booking Events, Parties and Weddings and any other functions.
By this application the time of the user reduces because they can access any information related to event
Address/venue/Hall from the remote place online.

   So that I am trying to make a web application that includes all the planningâ€™s for the venues, invitations, food,
Photography and all Event related things can be done on time. This application will make the users comfortable
to enjoy each and every function along with their family, friends, relatives and colleagues.

   My kid goes to a sports club in which his coaches keep doing events like Charity, Education to Succeed, Stream
Cleaning etc. This gave me idea if they have this kind of application where they can manage all there planning and
booking from one place that will be helpful.
