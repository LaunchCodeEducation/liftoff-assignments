## Submission Instructions

### Overview
It is usually difficult to determine the direction of a stocks price with daily fluctuations.
This financial app will allow a user to query stock market data by its stock ticker. The result will be a page with a section containing its current stock price and other financial related data(if possible). A section for a line graph with an option for the user to choose between daily and weekly stock price quotes to help predict trends and buy/sell opportunities. A simple moving average line will overlay onto the price quote line smoothing out the direction of the stock price fluctuations making it easier for the user to determine direction.
