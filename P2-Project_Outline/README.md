## Submission Instructions

### Overview
	Youâ€™re a person who likes to stay active and you've just moved to a new city. Many of your hobbies are things that incorporate staying active such as mountain biking, hiking, or swimming, and you would love to meet people who share your same interests and hobbies. \This web application will allow you to make an account with a schedule that includes your planned activities. Each  scheduled activity will show the skill level plus the date, time, and location of your planned activity. You will also be able to browse other user accounts to find people in your area with the same activities and skill level as yourself. You will be able to connect with them and coordinate together. This idea was thought of because things like hiking and mountain biking are not always safe to do alone and are just more fun in the company of others so creating something that is specifically designed to bring these types of people together seemed useful.
