## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project came about from the fact that makeup expires and after that, it can become less effective or even harmful. A lot of people don't realize that so they just never throw it out. My program allows users to enter the date they started using a product and how long it lasts, and it gives them the date it expires. It can be used for anything that has an expiration date that people can't readily remember. They will be able to receive notification that their product expires that day so they know to throw it out.
