## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am an avid person in the CrossFit community.  One of the things I see posted on social media are people who are traveling and do not have any ideas for workouts.  My application would help them find what they need and make their planning easy.

The client would enter the type of equipment that they have at the gym like dumbbells, barbells, or medicine balls.  The app would have a database of workouts and would match a workout with the equipment they have on hand.  This is a travel WOD app, but could be used even in your own home or office.  It would include workouts using just your own body weight.
### Features
1.  Drop down box search:  Each client can select their equipment and the app will search the database for workouts that include those options.
2.  Links:  Links to other workout routines and ideas.  This can be used when you might be at a normal gym and have a great equipment selection.
3.  Login:  Each client can login and able to see what workouts they have done in the past.

### Technologies
1. Python
2. C#
3. Flask
4. MySQL

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will probably have to learn to do a 3rd party API for a listing of Travel WODs and others I can input manually.  I think I will have to perfect MySQL a bit more then what I have in the past.  I would like to learn how to have a still picture in the background, but your app info moves up and down.
