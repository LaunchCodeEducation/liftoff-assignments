## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here

My application will provide users the ability to track fitness and activity. I got this idea
a couple of months ago when I realized that for about 8 years I have not tracked my own
progress in weight lifting or running.

I know that I have gotten stronger or faster...but I
do not have the data to necessarily 'prove it'. This will be useful to me and others because
it pinpoints the areas that one may need to improve in and tracks progress over time.

### Features
Include Features here

*User Signup: Users will be able to create accounts and log into the app.
*Data Input: Users will be able to input fitness data(i.e. weight lifted)
*Provide weekly/monthly statistics. Users will be able to view data by day, week or month
to quantify data over time.

### Technologies
Include Technologies here

*Vaadin
*Google Fit REST API
*SpringBoot
*MySQL

### What I'll Have to Learn
Include what you will need to learn here

I will have to learn how to incorporate Google's Fit API, Bootstrap and Vaadin into
my project. I also want to possibly enable images or videos of exercises that users can use
to create a workout plan.
