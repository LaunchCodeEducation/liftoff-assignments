## Submission Instructions

### Overview

My project is a web application to manage their collection of video games. 
It will allow them to easily see and organize their game collection to fit their needs.
It was inspired by the fact that as my own game collection has grown, I sometimes find it difficult to remember if I've already purchased a game or not.
