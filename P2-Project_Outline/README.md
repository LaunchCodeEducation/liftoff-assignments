## Submission Instructions

### Overview

Website that will allow people to study and research philosophy. It will also allow users to discuss what they have read, ask questions, and post their own philosophical writings. I will be solving a problem that many people run into. Though websites like this one have already been created they usually require restricted access (such as being a student or staff member at a university), or they merely contain information about philosophical writings and philosophers rather than the writings themselves (such as wikis, or peer reviewed articles). This application will utilize a SQL database to store all the information to create a user friendly and comprehensive library of philosophy. 

### Features

*	User login
* Search database by philosophical branch.
*	Make post and comments, for discussion and philosophical debate.
*	Form submission for userâ€™s writings.
*	Upload files

### Technologies

*	Java
*	MySQL
*	SQLAlchemy
*	SpringBoot
*	ThymeLeaf
*	JavaScript

### What I'll Have to Learn

I will have to learn how to upload files into a database so that I can upload pdf files, images, and allow users to upload files as well. I will have to learn how to use JavaScript to make posting and discussion more user friendly, and move the overall look of the site away from Bootstrap to create a clean and fluid user experience. I hope the development of this website will challenge me, teach me  a lot of new knowledge, and I hope the finished product will encourage many to be philosophers.
