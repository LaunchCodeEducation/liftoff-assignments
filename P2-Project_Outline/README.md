### Overview
I'm designing a point of sale system using the Bootstrap CSS so that it will be usable for 
mobile devices such as tablets. Doing so should improve customer service and their
interactions by removing tha physical separations of a retail transactions and creating 
a friendlier, more interactive atmosphere. In today's age where e-commerce is becoming a 
preferred option to the physical shopping experience, something must be done to improve  
this before we lose many jobs with the closing of these stores. From a coding aspect, I 
feel this is the most beneficial contribution. To be able to receive, and sell stock, plus 
run a retail location all from a mobile device will create a more open and friendly 
atmosphere improving customer service and thus improving the amount of customers going to 
that store.
