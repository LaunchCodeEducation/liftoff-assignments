## Submission Instructions

### Overview
When I was at the LaunchCode birthday gala, my husband and I tried to donate 3 times and it failed. We said we would do it later, but we never did. To solve this problem, I will make a better/faster way to donate to charities at events using smartphones. It will be called the Donation Station. The charity will have a number that the user will text with the amount they wish to donate. A text will be sent back with an apple pay link.

### Features
SMS: Donors will use text to send donation amount and receive apple pay link.
Email: Donors and Charities will receive an email confirmation.
User Login: Charities will be able to log in and see the donor information.
CRUD: Relevant info will be stored for tax purposes.
Apple/Android Pay: Stripe API to handle payment details.

### Technologies
Java
Bootstrap
SQLAlchemy
MySQL
JavaScript
REST
HTML



### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to use API for Twillo and Stripe. I will need to learn bootstrap for the payment page design and JavaScript for the code in users' browser. I will also need to figure out how to send emails.
