Overview
Overview:
Look into pet rescuers and participating shelters and clinics across the country with this app. This app will provide users with a list of facilities that care for all animals in need.
Lost pet alerts for missing animals in your area.
Should your pet become sick, find the available care wherever you are with a full list of veterinarians, clinics,and hospitals in each state. The care provided by each participating caregiver will be listed along with hours. For example, whether or not they provide 24 hour care. Do they provide care for exotics?
Prevent unwanted pets - A list of Spaying or neutering facilities. This guarantees that we have done our part to reduce pet overpopulation. and demonstrates your commitment to your animal's welfare.
A list of shelters and pet rescues in each state.
Adopt from a shelter - List of animals available for adoption. Essentially it will be a one stop app and decrease the time you spend searching for animal care especially in emergencies and with covid policies in place. This idea came to me when I had a life and death dog emergency and most places I called or googled were full to capacity. I would have loved to have a website to go to and look for help in my state with all the information in one place.
