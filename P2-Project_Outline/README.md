## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I'm trying to eat healthier by cooking at home rather than eating out. However, since keeping track of recipes stored in various forms in various locations (e.g. notecards, online links, phone photos of grandma's handwritten recipes) is inconvenient, I'd like to create a program that stores recipes in a database. I'd also like to functionality into the program that allows a user to connect to other users and thereby also view recipes those other users have posted.
### Features
1. "User login: Users will be able to create accounts, and log in to the application."
2. Post recipes: Users will be able to add new recipes when logged in. New recipes will be displayed in a list viewable to the user and any other users to whom the user is connected.
3. Connect to other users: User will abe able to request and accept connections to other users and if the connection is accepted, the two users will be able to view each other's recipes.
### Technologies
Java,
IntelliJ IDEA,
MAMP,
MySQL,
Spring Boot,
Hibernate ORM
### What I'll Have to Learn
1. How to integrate session functionality into a Java application in order to enable user-associated sessions.
2. How to build a dynamic recipe-entry interface in order to for the user to enter more or less ingredients for a recipe.
