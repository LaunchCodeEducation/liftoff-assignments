## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Smartphone overuse and addiction has been making headlines, so much so that key features of both Android's and iPhone's latest operating systems are tools designed to help users track and even limit their phone usage. Android's interpretation, called "Digital Wellbeing" includes the ability to switch the display to grayscale mode, aiming to dull the user's temptation to click on those colorful, enticing app icons. This project will extend this functionality, allowing users to customize the when, where, what, and why of grayscale mode. That is, users will be able to set grayscale mode based on time schedules (grayscale after 9pm on weekdays) and location (grayscale at work), as well as whitelist color sensitive apps (Camera, Image Editors), and even set time limits on color (Instagram goes gray after 10 minutes). This allows users to control their impulses and use apps in a more mindful, intentional manner.

### Features
- Scheduler: Users will be able to set grayscale mode to turn on and off automatically based on time of day and day of week.
- Location: Users will be able to set grayscale mode to turn on and off based on locaton.
- Whitelist: Users will be able to select which of their apps are exempt from grayscale mode.
- Timer: Users will be able to set time limits on app usage before grayscale mode activates (ex. 60 minutes of color per day, 10 minutes of color per hour)

### Technologies
Node.js

Ionic / Cordova

React Native

### What I'll Have to Learn
Will need to learn node and react, expanding on the skills I already have with javascript and Vue. Also need to figure out how grayscale mode is controlled on each mobile OS.
