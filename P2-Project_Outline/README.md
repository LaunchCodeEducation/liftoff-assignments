## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I would like to create a website for communications between teachers and students' parents. 
Teachers have the option to create posts for announcements that parents can view and comment on. 
Parents and teachers can send private messages to each other. I got the idea because I often receive emails, 
paper flyers, and paper notices from my son's teacher, and it can be hard to track all the different activities and their dates.
Such a website would allow parents to view all those information in one place and ask questions if needed.
