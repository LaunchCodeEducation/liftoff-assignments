## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I serve as a Board member for Plowsharing Crafts, a not-for-profit, fair trade store with two brick and mortar locations. Currently, 35-40% of the company's sales take place at offsite locations such as festivals, church bazaars and conferences. But, there is no system by which to track which sales are the most profitable year-over-year, which sales have the highest return on investment or even which sales we consistently attend.  The soon-to-retire Executive Director has this data in his head and on paper scattered throughout files.  
An application that would store basic information related to each offsite sale, calculate the ROI for the sale and help to determine profitability for each sale location would allow the new Executive Director to make analytical decisions about which sales are profitable enough to attend and where to allocate our resources (volunteer hours and inventory). 
### Features
Create - the Executive Director will be able to create offsite sale objects that include all neccessary data for analytic decision making
Edit - the Executive Director will be able to edit offsite sales that are in progress to update expenses and sales
Search - the Executive Director will be able to search completed offsite sales
Sort - the Executive Director will be able to sort completed offsite sales by year, location, name, ROI

### Technologies
Java 8
Thymeleaf
Tomcat
SpringBoot
IntelliJ
Bootstrap
phpMyAdmin
MAMP


### What I'll Have to Learn
how to calculate ROI within Thymeleaf (pulling data from objects and then making calculations with it and sending it back to view)
how to sort by various criteria
using Google maps data to determine location of sales which determines mileage and time for volunteers 
everything CSS/Bootstrap - this is where my experience is the weakest
