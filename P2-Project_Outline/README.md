### Overview

SouthSide Early Childhood Center enrolls children from all walks of life and many different backgrounds into its high-quality early education programs. Nearly half of SouthSide parents speak Spanish as their primary lanugage. While many staff and teachers at the Center speak Spanish and parent activities are offered in English and Spanish, Spanish-speaking parents are not as fully engaged in their child's educational journey as the staff would like. SouthSide seeks an easy-to-use web-based application for Spanish-speaking parents to access activities and information in their own language and to communicate with their child's teacher, strengthening parent-child interactions, increasing parent engagement and building children's cognitive and social skills. 

### Features
1. User Login
Users will be able to create accounts using a user name and password. Users include parents (and other primary caregivers), teachers/staff, and admin. Each user will be directed to the appropriate welcome page. For parents, the landing page will be the starting point to select enrichment activities. When logging in, users will select English or Spanish and the rest of their session will be in that language. 
2. The parent landing page will allow parents to select activities that meet criteria by subject (math, literacy, etc.), age (infant, toddler, pre-K), and where/when to do it (mealtime, grocery store, laundromat, etc.), or select "all."  
3. Parents will be able to either complete activities or save them to "My List." Upon completion, they will be asked to send either a photo of the activity or a few words about what their child learned. They will be able to ask the teacher to contact them. The completed activity will go to the "My List" page with other completed activities. (Photos and text entries will not be saved.)
4. Activities will be coordinated with weekly lessons at school. Teachers will enter activities, and SouthSide staff will translate entries into Spanish and enter them. 
5. SouthSide will be able to use data to evaluate if the program improves parent engagement through a report that shows the number of completions by task and date.
