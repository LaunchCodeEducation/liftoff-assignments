# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

### Overview

My application will be a website for posting and viewing philosophy conferences. There is currently just one website
that all philosophers use for this purpose, and it is less than ideal. It is poorly organized and it is difficult
for philosophers to find the relevant information they wish to about each conference. The reason is that the various
conference posts are not very standardized; apart from each one having to put a conference name, location, date, topics,
and date by which to apply to the conference, the rest of the information for each conference is written in the
'conference description', but these vary greatly. Other pieces of information ought to be standardized - namely,
what submission type is required (a paper, and/or an abstract [a short description of a paper], and/or a cover letter,
etc.) and what the word restrictions are per submission type. Currently, these elements are thrown somewhere in each
conference description. They are a pain to find, and you have to click on a single conference post to find them.
Because of this, many of us actually copy these descriptions over to Microsoft Word and highlight all of the relevant
pieces of information, for easy reference.

I would like to make a site where all of the important elements are standarized; that is, anyone posting a conference
must fill each element into a box, not just in their open-ended conference description. Because these elements will
be standardized, I will display all of them clearly for each post on the page that shows every conference. Because
submission type and word restrictions are great determinants of whether someone will apply to a conference, being
able to see these easily would be appreciated. I will also make the page displaying all conferences able to be ordered
in different ways, depending on the user's preference - it will be able to be ordered by conference date, submission
date, submission type and word restrictions, country. This would be a great feature for philosophers, because they
sometimes want to apply to conferences that only require abstracts, or only require papers of a certain length, or
only take place in a certain location, etc. There is no way to do this on the current website for conferences.

I would also like users to be able to sign in, so that, by clicking on an icon, they will be able to say they are
'interested' in certain conferences. Then, they will be able to go to their own page of conferences they're
interested in to check again what dates they're on, etc. That's not possible on the current website.

I think this will be a great improvement over the current state of affairs.


### Features

1. User login, so philosophers can pick and refer to conferences they're interested in submitting to/attending.
2. Users will be able to set alerts (by email or text, e.g.) for submission or conference dates.
3. Those posting conferences will be able to upload their conference poster.

### Technologies

Java, Springboot, MySQL

### What I'll Have to Learn

How to do at least decent graphics, how to set up the ability to upload photos, how to set up the ability
to get email/text alerts, how to display a page that can be ordered by different factors (alphabetically for
some, numerically for others, some combination for others).
