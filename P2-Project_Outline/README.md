## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will make it easier for employers to create employee schedules. It will eliminate the stress of trying to satisfy every employees needs if they desire an off day or have unpredictable availability. The employer will only need to verify that all employees have turned in their availabilty for the work week and the computer system will generate the schedule based on the employees inputs.

It will be useful because there will be no one scheduled a wrong time to work due to human error. The employee can change their availabilty numerous times before the deadline.

I thought of this because my manager continously screws up the schedule each pay period. And it causes conflict with employees other obligations.
