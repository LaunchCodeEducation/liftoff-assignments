## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here
I took a class at Webster university on how to workout and make successful workout plans.
Once the class was over i started to notice that when most people go to the gym they don't have proper knowledge
on how to workout or cant afford a personal trainer.  My project is a social workout plan site. Where a user can
come to find the perfect workout plan or create them and share them with others. This site can be used to maximise
your workout results and also prevent someone from over working out and causing harm to themselves.
