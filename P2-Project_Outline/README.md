# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
An app that tells you where the cheapest groceries are. Users enter in items - like Ziploc gallon bags - they want to keep a record for, and add prices from different stores for an item as well as the unit of measure - such as a pack of 40 bags - those prices are for. The app can then show the lowest price per unit and what store offers that. Users would then be able to create a shopping list of selected items and where to buy them as a printable PDF or as an email to reference offline on their phone. For users that do grocery shopping on a budget, this app would be faster and more convenient than manually calculating and writing out items, prices, and quantities on a piece of paper or in a Google spreadsheet, as I do now.
### Features
•	Create and update items and stores: Users can create new items or stores in the app. They can add multiple prices from a single store for a single item and the most recently-added price will be displayed as the current item price for that store. The lowest current price for an item across the different stores will be displayed as that item’s lowest price along with the store offering that price.
•	User login: Users can create and login to their account and enter a default email address for their account. Each account has its own set of items and stores with information entered and edited only by the user of that account.
•	Create offline shopping lists: Users can select items to be included on a shopping list. The list can be exported into a printer-friendly PDF, or sent as a formatted email to the user’s default email address or another address of their choosing.
•	Search and sort: Users can view their complete list of items or stores alphabetically, or by the date they were last created or updated. Users can also search by a given text for matching items.

### What I'll Have to Learn
To build this project, I will need to learn how to have my program produce custom PDFs and emails. If I wish to include a feature to sort items by distance from users’ current location, I will likely need to learn how to integrate Google Maps API and its functionality into my app. If I wish to build my program as an actual offline app for mobile devices, I may need to learn Swift.
