## Submission Instructions

### Overview
An application that will allow automotive service departments customers to be able to keep records of their car service easier. Many service departments have software that allow record keeping but customers do not have the same app on their end. Also, many times customers lose paperwork that pertains to car service records. This app will allow customers to log in to a secure account, to update their profile with current and previous cars owned and their service records, and to make a list that shows all automotive work done to each car.

### Technologies

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to incorporate multiple drop down menus on the same page and store them as separate items in the database, in order to search for certain terms, but then to be able to display them in a one line format. I will also have to learn how to really incorporate some bootstrap templates to make the page exciting and not boring.
