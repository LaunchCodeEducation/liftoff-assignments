## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am a fitness instructor for Pure Barre, a full-body, low-impact workout that tones and strengthens the hips, thighs,
seat, abdominals, and arms. I love being an instructor and I teach four to five classes a week. Building a class takes
a lot of preparation. I have to put together choreography from headquarters in the right order following all the rules
to create a class. Plus, I need to change my class each time to keep things interesting. I want to create a tool that
can help Pure Barre instructors plan unique and challenging classes quickly and easily. The tool will be able to record
all classes taught and make recommendations for teachers. This tool will also link to our MindBody account so that both
teachers and managers can make sure clients are getting individual care and experiencing unique classes.


### Features
User login - Teachers and Managers will be able to create accounts, log in to the application, and see all classes
taught.

Class Planner - The class planner will be programmed with all exercises, rules, and dependencies so that teachers can
easily create classes.

Playlist Notes - Teachers will be able to rate and leave comments about playlists, to help teachers choose
playlists for class.


### Technologies
Java
SpringBoot
MySQL
SQLAlchemy
Thymeleaf templates
API
Angular

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn how to set up a public API to connect to our Pure Barre MindBody account to see which clients are
taking each class. I will also need to learn how to connect videos to each exercise so that teachers can preview the
exercise. Currently these videos are on our Pure Barre Schoox Account that I will need to access somehow. I will also
need to learn a front-end language like Angular, JavaScript, or React to build a program that teachers will want to use.
