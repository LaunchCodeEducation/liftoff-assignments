# Capstone Project Plan

## Overview

I am working on an employee database app. The app will allow the user to store information about employees and their skills. The user 
will be able to manipulate that information. The user can update or delete information. It will be user-friendly and provide error 
messages when the user enters incorrect data.

## Features

User login: User will be able to create an account, and log in to the app.
Search: User will be able to search for employees and skills.
Sort: User will be able to sort data by name field, email field, or description field.

## Technologies

-Java
-Spring
-MAMP
-IntelliJ

## What I'll Have to Learn

I have to learn how to retrieve data from the database in ascending or descending order. I have to learn how to add a search feature to 
my app. I have to learn about API. I also have to learn how to add JavaScript to make my app more interactive.
