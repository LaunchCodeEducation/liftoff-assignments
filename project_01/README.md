# Capstone Project Plan

## Overview
<<<<<<< HEAD
     My project will be a dynamic website that allows users to browse, purchase, and sell various
paintings. This application will allow a platform for unknown artists to gain exposure and access a large
market to sell their works at a much lower commission than that of a traditional gallery.  

     Users will be able to view works from artists all over the world to purchase or gain inspiration
as well as reach out to other artists for collaboration.

    The idea for this project came from a friend that is a local artist in the St. Louis area,
he sees a need for local artists to gain exposure and be able to sell works.

## Features
User login: Users will be able to log in securely and have their own profile page.

Seller portfolio: Users that have been authorized to sell works will have a portfolio of works for sale on
                  their respective pages.

Search: Users will be able to search for works by various descriptions and labels populated by the selling artist.
        They will be able to search by size, style, artist, and content.

Persistent wish list: Users will be able to store works on their wishlists that they can view from their respective user pages.

Messaging: Users will be able to communicate with messages sent in program.

Payment: Users will be able to  securely complete transactions over the internet using paypal.

## What I'll Have to Learn
  I will have to learn how to use paypal API as well as develop a plan for handling the messages feature.  
I suspect I could handle messaging with what I know, but not in real time with notifications.  I will have to learn
a lot more about styling as well in order to make this page look as good as it would need to to appeal to artists and
lovers of art.
