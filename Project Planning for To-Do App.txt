User Stories:

As a user I want to edit my tasks that are currently in progress, so that if anything changes or I need to input a important detail I can do that with ease.

As a user, I want to login to my account, in order to post updates, see the days current tasks and check completion so I can continue using effective time management.

As a personal assistant with many clients, I need to be able to quickly view my tasks using a view tasks button, so that I can manage tasks for each client.

As a small business owner, I spend a lot of time keeping the books, tracking inventory & doing payroll due to staff limitations, so having an app that I can enter tasks, edit tasks and also get the specific details about the task helps keep me in-the-know day to day.
